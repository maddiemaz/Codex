# Codex

Codex is a collaborative online database for storytellers and creatives to keep their ideas, concepts, and characters organized, available, and editable wherever they are.

Writers are notorious for using a variety of odd and disorganized methods for keeping their worldbuiling straight -- everything from Excel to Word to a notebook to random file folders on their computers. Codex provides a platform for storybuilding specifically, and allows for others to view, edit, and share their indeces.
